These app was developed in order to test a way to use react features and AR.js features as well

Here I'm was able to implement AR.js and create a SPA with splash screen.


## Stacks

**Front-end:** React


## Functionalities

- React App
- Splash screen to prevent camera permission on start.
- SPA
- Custom 3D model
- Play .GLB embbended animations



## Demonstration

Try it on [AR.js React Test](https://www.arjs-react-test.vercel.app)

## Improvements

- Today we are experiencing and error in the custom asset used in the demonstration, 
a flickering, cause still being investigated.
- TypeScript still not well implemented sadly causing trouble in the implementation.
- Build interactions with the 3D model through DOM buttons
- Investigate camera not being correctly positioned when started, probable cause is
a bug in orientation retrieve from the source library.
